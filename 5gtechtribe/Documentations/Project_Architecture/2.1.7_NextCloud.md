### 2.1.7 NextCloud 

Nextcloud is a cloud storage platform that facilitates the creation and use of file hosting services with functionality like those of its industry competitors, such as Dropbox. Although Nextcloud is open-source and publicly accessible, it does not provide on-premises file storage hosting. Instead, it provides the option of installation on private servers. File sharing, chatting, updating shared documents, and private information management are just a few of the features that meet a wide range of user needs, from home offices to large-scale corporate settings. [7] It also offers a range of improvements via its Nextcloud Hub, which is distinguished by a high-performance file management backend that expedites user alerts and dramatically lowers server load. Improved page loading times and teamwork tools like the Whiteboard tool and Nextcloud Talk's sophisticated messaging features are among these upgrades. Furthermore, Nextcloud Hub integrates upgrades to groupware features, such as better email threading and drag-and-drop capability, which boost team efficiency and facilitate smooth communication processes.
