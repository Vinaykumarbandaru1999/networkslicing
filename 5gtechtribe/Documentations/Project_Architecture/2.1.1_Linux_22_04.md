### 2.1.1 Linux 22.04 

Linux, an open-source operating system kernel, powers a wide range of computing devices, from personal computers to servers and embedded systems. In this project we have used Linux version 22.04 as the operating system, facilitating the setup of the 5G infrastructure. Linux 22.04 serves as a reliable foundation for deploying and administering the 5G infrastructure, offering stability and compatibility with essential software and tools required for setting up and managing 5G networks. This version of Linux provided a reliable environment for achieving project objectives, enabling seamless integration and operation of the 5G configuration within defined constraints.[8]
