# 3.4 Kamailio SIP Server Configurations


This guide provides instructions for establishing a SIP proxy using Kamailio on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. SIP, or Session Initiation Protocol, serves as the foundation for contemporary VoIP communication, facilitating smooth interactions encompassing voice and video calls, messaging, and various digital exchanges. 


## Step 1: Installing Kamailio
To begin, update your system's package list:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
Then, install Kamailio and the required SIP modules:

```bash
sudo apt-get install kamailio kamailio-sqlite-modules kamailio-tls-modules
```

Step 2: Configuring Kamailio
Edit the Kamailio configuration file located at /etc/kamailio/kamailio.cfg using your preferred text editor. You'll need to set several parameters to configure Kamailio as a SIP proxy:

```bash
nano /etc/kamailio/kamailio.cfg
```

Within the configuration file, set the SIP domain and listening interfaces. Look for the #!define WITH_MYSQL directive and uncomment it if you are using MySQL as your database backend. Similarly, uncomment the #!define WITH_TLS if you plan to use TLS for secure SIP communication.

Step 3: Creating the SIP User Database
To enable Kamailio to manage users, you'll need to create a database. You can use SQLite, as specified during the installation, or any other supported database system. Here, we'll create a simple SQLite database:

```bash
kamdbctl create
```

Follow the prompts to set up the database. Once created, add users to the database using Kamailio's user management tool:

Step 4: Starting Kamailio
After completing the configuration, start the Kamailio service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start kamailio
```

Ensure Kamailio starts automatically on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable kamailio
```

Verify the status of the Kamailio service to ensure it's running properly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status kamailio
```

Step 5: Testing the Configuration
To confirm that Kamailio is functioning correctly, use a SIP client to register with the server using the user credentials created earlier. Successful registration and call tests will confirm that Kamailio is properly set up as a SIP proxy.
